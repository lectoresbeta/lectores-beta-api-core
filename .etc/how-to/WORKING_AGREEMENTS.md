1. Help each other
2. Convince, do not impose
3. Common sense
4. Be aware about the tooling that we have in the project
5. Find solutions, not the guilty ones
6. Bring with proposals before asking for help :pray:

### Code :computer:

1. Boyscout rule (leave your code better than you found it).
2. Testing culture, the more, the better.
3. Reuse code. (It doesn't means apply **DRY** without any sense).
4. Do not use **deprecated** library versions always LTS or enough maintained.
5. Every single change must be under PR even a hotfix or a revert commit

### Pull requests :octocat:

1. Small PR's **the smaller, the better** (max. 35 files).
2. PR's always in sync with the target branch
3. 1 PR === 1 commit :pray:
4. **The most clear the PR explanation**, the better.
5. Each PR must be approved at least for one mate through a comment `APPROVED :heavy_check_mark:`
6. As soon as PR get approve, it should be merged and deployed.
